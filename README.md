Data Cleaning: In this step we prepare the data for further analysis by removing null values, transforming and standardizing our data.
Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.
Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.
Evaluation: After model development we check the Confusion metrics and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

Tools & Technology used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,

Conclusion
ave drawn many interesting inferences from the dataset employee_dataset;
